# Batcher lib

Made to facilitate API calls by caching, batching and (possibly) executing them in the background.

This is a WIP, for now I just migrated it from the KeeVee repo.

- `AbstractBatch` subclasses should be used via class methods to retrieve certain objects.
- `AbstractBatch.request()` adds an object request to a non-full batch and returns the receipt of that request.
- `AbstractBatch().get_value()` retrieves an object from an executed batch based on the arguments stored in the receipt (ex: Line Item ID)
- Instead of `AbstractBatch().get_value()`, `Receipt().get()` should be used. This will automatically run the batch and wait for its results. After that, the result will be returned.
- `AbstractBatch` also saves the object-to-batch associations, so when that object is requested again, itâ€™s returned from the cache.
The cache could be updated manually when other batches request the same object
